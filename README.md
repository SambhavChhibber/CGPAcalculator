This project is a Java based CGPA calculator made for B.Tech Computer Science students. The idea behind this program was to make something that actually feels useful and practical instead of just a basic calculator. The program first asks for the student’s details and the current semester, and based on that semester it automatically shows the subjects that are studied in that term. The user only needs to enter the percentage for each subject and the program handles everything else. It calculates the semester percentage, converts it into CGPA, and also gives a clear performance level such as excellent, good, average or below average. Along with this, it shows which subject the student performed best in and which subject needs more improvement. The program also assigns grades for each subject so that the student can quickly understand their overall standing. Input validation is handled properly so wrong values do not crash the program. Overall, this project was built to strengthen my understanding of Java fundamentals like arrays, methods, loops and conditional logic, while also creating something that reflects a real academic use case.
